# Design and Implementation of a Scalable and Reliable Data Pipeline for Efficiently Fetching, Storing, and Analyzing Structured Data from Links using Hadoop, Hive, AWS Glue, and Amazon RDS

## Objective :
To fetch data from this link (https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/), store it in HDFS, create a Hive table to view the data, extract the data from the AWS Glue schedule job, and store it in an Amazon RDS database. The first step is to verify that you have access to the link and are able to download the data. Next, you will need to determine the format of the data and, if it is in a structured format, determine the schema. Then, you can use a tool like wget or curl to download the data directly from the link and use the HDFS command line interface to store it in HDFS. You will then create a Hive table and load the data into the table. You can view the data in the table and verify that it has been correctly loaded. As an optional step, you can create a script to automate this process so that you can easily refresh the data in the Hive table as new data becomes available. To extract the data from the AWS Glue schedule job and store it in the RDS database, you will need to install and configure the AWS Glue ETL service, create an AWS Glue job that reads the data from HDFS and writes it to the RDS database, and run the AWS Glue job to extract the data and load it into the RDS database. You can then verify that the data has been correctly loaded into the RDS database by querying the appropriate table(s).

## Approach:
1. Verify that you have access to the link and are able to download the data. You can do this by using a tool like wget or curl to download the data from the link.
2. Determine the format of the data and, if it is in a structured format, determine the schema. You can use tools like file or strings to determine the format of the data, and you can use tools like head or less to view the data and determine its structure.
3. Create a Hive table to store the data. You can do this by running a CREATE TABLE statement in the Hive shell or by using the hive command line interface.
4. Load the data into the Hive table using the LOAD DATA statement.
5. Install and configure the AWS Glue ETL service.
6. Create an AWS Glue job that reads the data from HDFS and writes it to the RDS database.
7. Run the AWS Glue job to extract the data from HDFS and load it into the RDS database.
8. Verify that the data has been correctly loaded into the RDS database by querying the appropriate table(s).
9. (Optional) Create a script to automate the process of fetching data from the link, storing it in HDFS, and loading it into the RDS database. This script can be scheduled to run at regular intervals using the AWS Glue scheduling feature to refresh the data in the RDS database as new data becomes available.

## Expected Results:
- The result of following the above approach should be that you are able to fetch data from the specified link, store it in HDFS, create a Hive table to view the data, extract the data from the AWS Glue schedule job, and store it in an Amazon RDS database. You should also be able to verify that the data has been correctly loaded into the RDS database by querying the appropriate table(s).
- As an optional step, you should also be able to create a script to automate the process of fetching data from the link, storing it in HDFS, and loading it into the RDS database. This script can be scheduled to run at regular intervals using the AWS Glue scheduling feature, allowing you to easily refresh the data in the RDS database as new data becomes available.
- Overall, this approach should provide a reliable and efficient way to retrieve, store, and access data from a specified link, allowing you to easily incorporate this data into your data analysis and reporting processes.
